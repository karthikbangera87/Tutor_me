The tutor search and scheduling is a web application that provides help to students look for a suitable tutor for a particular course. The aim is to provide students with a platform where they can practice peer tutoring, thereby giving a new facet to learning. The system suggests a list of tutors to a student on the basis of the tutor\'92s existing profile and the system also helps in maintaining a schedule so as to avoid common hindrances due to same room being allocated or conflicting timings. Thereby providing the students with a hassle-free environment.\

The user id is unique by default, so when a user registers with user id \'93xyz\'94 a confirmation link is sent to xyz@indiana.edu. The system will validate a user only when that confirmation link is clicked and will then redirect the new user to the create profile page.

\f0\fs32 \cf0 3.Timetable for Tutor: In addition to the general profile details if a user wants to be a tutor he needs to fill in additional details. He needs to give a list of courses that he is proficient in, he also needs to give available timeslots for future reference, and the system maintains the available timeslots and refreshes them after every two weeks. This is done so that a tutor can edit his timetable depending on his need, the timetable is used to schedule future appointments.\
4.Tutor Searching: Students can use the search button to find suitable tutors according to their criteria. Once a student clicks on search for a particular course by entering the course id, the system goes through all the tutors in the system and generates a list of tutors teaching that course. Also when a student is searching for the tutor he is required to put in a date on which he wants a tutor, this date is then used by the system to match with the available dates of all the tutors teaching that course, then the system generates a smaller list of suitable tutors. So once the student gets the tutor they can visit their profile to get a better idea about them, and then make an informed decision on which tutor to choose.\
5.Scheduling: Once the student selects a tutor he is asked to select any one of the time slots from the available slots of the tutor, once he selects one the system generates a schedule. Also it gives the status as pending and sends a notification to the tutor who needs to confirm or reject the appointment. Once he accepts the appointment the schedule is finalized. A tutor can also reschedule the appointment and then the student is notified of the change.\
6.Notifications: The system alerts a tutor when some other users have applied to take tuition for them. They can either accept or reject. Also when a tutor reschedules an appointment the student associated with the schedule is notified. Also once a student completes a schedule he is prompted to rate the tutor thereby helping the system maintain a rank of the tutor for a particular course he teaches.\
7.Rating: Students can give a rating to a tutor after they finish an appointment with the tutor. But for a subject they can rate the tutor only one session, so it is advisable to rate the tutor after the last session. The system will keep a record of the ratings for each tutor with reference to the course. This information will be used to recommend the tutor in the future.\
